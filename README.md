# Archive It!

A super simple Slack bot to archive discussiones from a channel in a JSON format.

## How to use it?

Run the following command:

```
/archiveit <message>
```

The bot will then get every message sent to the channel of `<message>` since that message until you send the command and save it as a JSON.
